      <p>
        Sometimes it was really hard to follow, because I don't know how to code
        properly and also due to the fact that you had to cover a HUGE amount of
        content in a short period of time.

      <p>
        That coding but specifically the syntax and what all the certain
        functions and keys do is very difficult. It seems that all the functions
        have lots of different uses and I found it hard to remember what thing
        did what. However, like desigining, its extremely satisfying when you
        get something down (even if it looks terrible).
